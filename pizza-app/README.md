# React Pizza Store 🍕 🍕 🍕

A simple front-end pizza store built using React, Semantic UI React and a dash of Stripe Elements. I did this project to get more comfortable with React.

## Features ✨

* **Postcode validator on Home page** - enter pincode.
* **Shopping cart** - see and edit your order.
* **Checkout page** - for the purposes of this demo website, you can click on 'Fill with fake customer' to populate fields.
* **Order confirmation page** displays customer's first name and address and a button to start the fun all over again.

## Get up and running 🚀

    npm install
    npm start
    npm test
